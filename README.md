# Meme-Generator
A C# Project by Ben Highsted. 

The idea is to create memes from random images and random templates. 

I chose C# for this as I was looking for a project to get experience in C#.

To Compile:
csc /target:exe /out:MemeGenerator.exe MemeGenerator.cs

To Run:
mono MemeGenerator.exe

Currently this will only work with my templates, but will work with any images.
